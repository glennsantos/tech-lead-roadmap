## The Tech Lead Roadmap, Î± version

This is my initial version of this roadmap and is a work in progress. The content taken is from exhaustive research, surveys among developer in leadership positions, and feedback from mentors. Any comments are appreciated!

Make sure you go through the [Senior Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/glennsantos/senior-developer-roadmap/) first!

If you prefer something actionable, [jump to the checklist version here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Spv2mdzB5eEvHuCr5CY2XZZ2T-PxahMMa9RC6VVb4BA/edit). _TIP: Go to File > Make a Copy so you can have your own checkable copy of the checklist._

We also have a mentorship program where we help developers become leaders. [Come join us](https://tally.so/r/3leK5w)!
